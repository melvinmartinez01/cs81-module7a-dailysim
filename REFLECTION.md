# Reflection – Daily Schedule Simulator

## What was your approach to designing the schedule?
My approach was to use my morning routine on a typical work day (when I have an opening shift). I decided to use this since this is a constant routine that does not change unless I am not opening.
The idea for the random event came from what my store. We have a bell at the front that says "Ring the bell if you're feeling the vibe!", and when the bell was rung, we (employees) would have to 
cheer. In this case, I changed it so that it would randomly run "Peanut butter jelly time!".

## What was one challenge or unexpected behavior you encountered?
One challeneged I face was trying to understand where to place the setTimeout() and the random event.

## What does this assignment teach you about async code?
This taught me how more than one code could be running, as you're working on other things.

## What creative element did you add?
I added the "PEANUT BUTTER JELLY TIME!" event

## How does this project simulate or differ from real-world schedules?
This works with alarms. If you were to have one for 1 pm, and the next at 1:02 pm, as your allow is going off, the alarm is still running, and will end up completing the next task as well.
